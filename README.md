# Docker
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. 
Conainers are Flexibile, lightweight, portable, loosely coupled, scalable and secure.
Docker image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
