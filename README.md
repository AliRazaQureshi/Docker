# Docker
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. 
Conainers are Flexibile, lightweight, portable, loosely coupled, scalable and secure.
Docker image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
## Containers VS Virtual Machines
A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs incur a lot of overhead beyond what is being consumed by your application logic.
